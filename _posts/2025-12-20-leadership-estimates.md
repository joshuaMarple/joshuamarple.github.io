## Decisions decisions decisions

DO NOT SUBMIT: describe how decision making at a high level is a process of deciding where to invest a very limited pool of resources with a low level of trust in what both predictions and in stable situations 

## What's in a project anyways?

DO NOT SUBMIT Explain that a project proposal isn't just "here's my big problem and my beautiful solution". It needs to explain what the impact of the project would be by some metric, ideally relating that metric back to a top level business metric (but not always) 

## RICE Scoring and ROI

DO NOT SUBMIT: explain that every project on the docket has to be stack ranked against every other. most projects actually can justify their own investment (as in, the project pays for itself). The problem is that usually the other problems can yield 5-10x their investment

## So how does this connect back to deadlines?

DO NOT SUBMIT: every project is being evaluated by that ROI: so the longer a project takes to complete, the lower the ROI is. Furthermore, the leads don't usually have a ton of experience in every single tech stack used in every proejct in their portfolio. Instead, they gauge the likelihood of success off of their perception of trust in the individuals involved in the project. So the more times you push out and delay a project without good reason the more you burn that trust.

## Why can't they just trust us?

DO NOT SUBMIT Its not that they don't trust that you really are experiencing a problem. They probably trust that you can solve it too. What they don't trust is that your problem is the absolute most pressing one on the docket. They see a thousand other potential projects, and can't do them all.

## Thinking like a gambler

DO NOT SUBMIT To balance all these competing priorities with different levels of trust, leads think like gamblers. They might have a big pot of investments, some with a high potential ROI and high risk, some with low ROI but low risk. You can't be in the bucket of low ROI and high risk- these projects never get funded. Understand how far out the team is looking — if they're making an investment for the next 3 months, don't try to get a 2 year vision funded.
